    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">In the Vedas it says that this is a very important topic. And it comes with the very important question. And the question is, “Who am I?”</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">But, unfortunately, we almost never ask this question. The reason is because we think we already know the answer. Of course, we all have our identities; we’ve had them our whole life. We have them in our minds, we have them on our lips, we have them in our pockets. Meaning this is who I think I am, this is who I tell others I am, and I prove it with my passport, my driver’s license, my documents. We accept it and so does everyone else.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">But is this our true identity? Upon close examination we find that this is just a compilation of many labels. And the labeling process begins at birth. So all of us here now, when we took birth, received one of two labels: male or female. And we still identify like that today: I’m a man or I’m a woman. At the same time we get another label according to our race: Caucasian, Negroid, whatever it is. And our family identity is very strong: we belong to this family. And our national identity: “Oh, I am Russian,” “I am American,” “I am German,” “I’m French.” See? Actually this identity is so strong that every day on this planet one person kills another person just because they have got a different label. But if you look closely, again you’ll see this is all in relation to the material body. It’s true: the body is male and female, black or white, old or young, big or little, whatever the body is, it is. Yes, that’s true. The question is, “Is this who we are?”&nbsp;<br><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Going to the Vedas, we learn that we are in a different category of energy. Our bodies are material energy. But we learn that we are spiritual energy. We further learn we are a tiny little spark of spiritual energy.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">We learn that material energy is temporary. That’s easy to see. We know all too well our bodies are very temporary; so much so we don’t even want to talk about it, “Hey, let’s don’t talk about that!” But even the more permanent things like this building… Come back in 1000 years, “Where was that lecture, again?” Very temporary. But we learn that spiritual energy is eternal. Eternal means no beginning and no end. So we are eternal.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">And we also learn that material energy is non-living. Again, easy to see. For instance, this table – there’s no life. But we learn that spirit is life itself. There is no such thing as live matter, there is no such thing as dead spirit. So we are the life force in the body. As long as we’re present in the body, the body’s called alive. Actually this is not true. The body’s dead. We are alive. And that becomes very obvious at the time of death. At the time of death the body reveals its true nature: can’t even sit in a chair, falls on the floor. We are the life force in the body. Our true identity is spirit soul. Spirit meaning that we are spiritual in essence, soul meaning the individual spiritual spark that we eternally are. We never become someone else. We never cease to exist.</span></p><p><br></p></blockquote></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">In the material world the truth, even as it is, is relative truth. It is relative; it is dependent on a whole lot of circumstances to make it true. An example is water. Water freezes at 0 degrees right? Yeah? No, only under certain set of circumstances – if it is at sea level, it boils at 100 degrees – at sea level. But take it to 3000 meters (9000 feet), it boils lower. So it is dependent on altitude and it depends on the purity of the water: put salt in the water, it doesn’t freeze at 0. All kinds of things are concerned in the ‘truth’.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Absolute truth is different than that. It is absolutely true always; it is not dependent on any other circumstances to make it true. We are absolutely spirit souls; we are not our material bodies. That is an absolute truth that never changes. I, the spirit soul, can enter into and do enter into many, many different bodies. This lifetime we are in human bodies, in this particular body we are in a male body, a female body, we have our certain set of parents etc., etc., whatever our situation is right now. That is who we are relatively as far as our body goes but the absolute identity is I am spirit soul. Next lifetime I may wind up in a dog body so now my external identity is a dog, but my eternal, true identity is the same, a spirit soul. I am not any different than before. Last lifetime I was in the human body, I am the same; I have just got on a different suit of clothes. I changed clothes, now I am looking like a dog and on and on it goes..&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">So as an absolute person we need to know the absolute truth. If I don’t know the absolute truth, I will never be free. “You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free." What is freedom? Again that is part of the illusion. “Freedom is the freedom to enjoy your senses uncontrollably, unrestricted. Anything you want to do, any sense desire you have, any desire in your mind that comes up, pursue it and therefore if you can do that without anybody getting in your way, you can be happy.” That is ‘freedom’. This is what people fight for. “I want to be able to do what I want to do, when I want to do it and how I want to do it.” That is considered freedom..</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">That is not freedom, that is bondage. We are more free in this way than ever before, there are fewer restrictions on our sensual activities than ever before. Is everybody feeling happy and satisfied? No, less so than ever before. In fact, the symptoms are the opposite, we are more depressed, have more anxiety, there is more mental disturbance, there is more crazy acts of violence, all kinds of things which are symptoms that this person is not happy, something is wrong here.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Freedom means I get off of the wheel of birth and death; that is freedom. Freedom from taking another material birth, freedom from being under the control of the laws of material nature, freedom from false identity, freedom from all of this illusion, freedom from all pain, suffering, hardship and death. Going to another world… there is another world and that world is called the spiritual world.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote></div>

The material world is composed primarily of material energy: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, etc. Material elements make up the material world. Inanimate: tables or microphones – there is no life. But interjected within this vast amount of material energy are tiny little spiritual sparks. That is us, the spirit soul. We are the spiritual personalities in this material world. But again completely misled, completely under this illusion I am the body, I am the enjoyer, I am the supreme and whatever. All this false identity; so we have a big problem..&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">If you break it down, down, down to who we are… We are not the body, we are not the mind; that is clear, and we get that out of the way, we are spirit soul. Ok, that is an amazing understanding. But then if we really go to the deepest level of understanding, we understand, “I, the spirit soul, I am not just spiritual energy, I am love. I am a little particle of love, because spirit is love.” It is not like love and spirit are separate. Love is synonymous with spirit so actually that is who I am. I am love. Why? Because I am a part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit. The Supreme Spirit known throughout the world as God, which so frightens people in a big way. “God? Hoo-hooh, I thought this is something else.” No. The Supreme Spirit from whom we come is love.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Have you ever heard that? “God is love.” Of course, but what does that mean? Is it just some vague whatever? No, it means the Supreme Spirit, the Supreme Person, who has many names, is love personified and we are tiny little love personified. Love is actually the only reason to live and that is why many people are not living and that is why people kill their bodies. Because there is no love, so there is no reason to live. The soul must have love to really fully live.</span></p></blockquote></div>

<section class="mbr-section article mbr-section__container" id="content2-46" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Loneliness is very easy to understand. You’re lonely because you’re alone, you’re not with someone that really makes you happy, that really fulfills your desire for companionship, to have someone to love. So even in a huge crowd of people, maybe you’re in a circle of so-called friends at a party, you’re still lonely. Because no one is there with you in your heart, you don’t feel that loving connection with someone. And even if you have someone you say you love, you still feel lonely, because the heart is lonely.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">And the problem is: we, the spirit soul, located in the heart, will only find our fulfillment… that person that we actually will find happiness with is the Supreme Lord, is God. So you will never find a lonely real lover of God. But in the material world where God is not even a part of our life at all, we try to fill up this need of the perfect person to love with all these other people: our friends, our relatives, and so on like that. But it doesn’t work. So sometimes the most famous or the most loaded people, the people who have the most friends and everybody’s, always around them, are still very, very lonely for this exact reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">So the only real solution is to reestablish our lost relationship with God. Then that loneliness will go away because He’s in our heart. God is in our heart. He is in our heart, He is known as the Paramatma, the Lord in the heart. He’s always with us, but we don’t see that, we’re separated. See? In our material consciousness we’re blind to His presence.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">So when we grow spiritually, when we purify our minds, when we purify our hearts of all this material contamination, actually begin to, as I always say, live a more complete spiritual lifestyle based on devotional service to God, then that relationship begins to unfold, it begins to grow. And I’m not alone. Whether I’m with a lot of people, whether I’m with nobody, whether if I’m on a deserted island, I’m still with the One I love and He is with me, and loneliness is the thing of the past, it’s history. And this is the only real solution.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">So by regularly hearing and chanting God’s names… which I always promote: chant the mantras, chant the names of God… this will bring us in direct contact with God and I will experience, «Oh, now I have someone in my life that fulfills me, that actually makes it so I’m not empty inside, I’m not lonely.» And I will never be lonely again in that loving relationship.</span></p></blockquote></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The concept of God is often misunderstood. The word God indicates a position, a post or a title. Just like the word “king” indicates a position, a post or a title. A person who occupies the position of king is known as the king and is accepted as the number one person in the kingdom. In the same way the Supreme Person occupies the position of God. He is known as God and He’s accepted as the Number One person of all.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">However He has many, many names. And the problem arises when we take one of God’s names, separate it from the rest, we build a “religion” around it and then declare, “This is the only true God!” For instance, one of God’s names is Jehovah, and there are people who would have us believe Jehovah is the only true God. But we understand it differently. This is one of God’s many names which means the All-powerful. And, of course, Krishna is one of God’s names. And people say, “Well, that’s the Hindu God.” So now we got a Hindu God, we got a Jehovah God. This is building a sect. And the great saint Bhaktivinoda Thakur declared that sectarianism is the greatest obstacle on the spiritual path. We must transcend sectarianism. And mantra meditation is non-sectarian.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">For example, which cubby hole can you put me in? Which slot do I fit in? Christian? Hmm… Buddhist? Hindu? Muslim? Something else? Actually, none of those, and that’s where people get confused. “What?! We have to put you somewhere.” No, it’s the eternal religion of the soul called sanatana-dharma. Sanatana means eternal, dharma means occupational duty. So it’s the eternal occupational duty of every soul, all souls, and that is loving service to God. There’s only one religion and that is love for God. There’s only one religious practice and it is serving God. It makes it really simple, and you don’t have all these conflicts. All these sects cause separateness. The world is so fragmented now because of all these false identifications. So you have your fragmentation due to race, to nationality, to religion, to politics and on and on it goes. So everybody’s separate, no union. And that’s the problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">But when you identify yourself as eternal spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, there’s no separation. Everyone’s the eternal servant of the Supreme Soul, no separation. It’s got to be on that level for there actually to be peace. As soon as you see differences, you’ll find some discord.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote></div>

Moving to an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean is not going to solve the problem. Then you’ll be stressed about, “I’m lonely.” You’ll be stressed about, “Where am I going to get something to eat?” You’re going to be stressed about, “Oooh, what am I going to do? I’m going to die here… alone?!”</p><p><br></p><p>So really there’s only one solution and it’s, again, a spiritual solution. If I have that loving relationship with God in my heart and I’m actively living my life in His service, I’m actually experiencing the happiness of this, then I’m peaceful inside, I’m calm inside. And so the whirlwind is flying all around me. There’s stress everywhere: there’s job stress, there’s environmental stress, there is pollution from the sound, and the food, and the air, and everything else. You know, the hurricane is tearing everything to pieces around us, but in the eye of the storm everything is calm and peaceful. So this is the only solution.</p></div>

													<div class="panel-body"><p>Happiness is the most sought after thing and also the most elusive. And the reason everyone is seeking happiness is because it’s the nature of the soul to be happy. However in the material world we don’t try to find the true happiness, which is spiritual happiness for us, the spirit soul. Due to illusion and false identification with our bodies, we conclude that if we make our bodies happy, we will be happy, and that is the pursuit of everybody: trying to find happiness through the stimulation of the senses.</p><p><br></p><p>And we have made great advancement in different ways to stimulate the senses, in finding various forms of sense gratification on many levels, but nobody’s happy. And the more we seek happiness, the more we put energy in finding our happiness in this way and experience that it doesn’t work, that we’re still unhappy, then the more frustrated we get and the more depressed we get.</p><p><br></p><p>So actually the only happiness is happiness that makes us, the spirit soul, happy; spiritual happiness coming from a lifestyle that is geared toward spiritual pursuit, spiritual inquiry, devotional activities in service to the Supreme Lord, and, foremost of all, the hearing and chanting of the names of God. Transcendental sound is the ultimate source of happiness.</p></div>

													<div class="panel-body"><p>Bhakti yoga means devotional yoga. The word ‘bhakti’ means ‘devotion’. This is the highest level of yoga. In the Vedas it is described as the topmost yoga system. And it is the only system where there are actual love and devotion. And this, of course, will bring us into the most intimate relationship with Bhagavan. And this is the perfection of life. So we do what we do throughout our day, throughout our life for the pleasure of Bhagavan.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like in this world. We will use an example. It is hard to find such a case but, let’s say there is a husband who is really lovingly devoted to his wife and family. His pleasure in life is seeing them happy. So really everything he does is connected with their pleasure. And he is always thinking of them. Maybe he is at his job working very hard, maybe he has to work late. But he knows why he is working late, “Now I can provide them with food, shelter,” whatever he does, “I can take care of them, I can protect them.” This is his happiness. That is bhakti.</p><p><br></p><p>But really, bhakti is reserved for Bhagavan. So when the soul reaches that level of yogi perfection, they experience the highest pleasure. And this also takes us to the spiritual world but to the part of the spiritual world where there is a direct eternal relationship with Bhagavan. And this is the perfection of life. This is what we are all missing.&nbsp;</p></div>
